The purpose of this assignment is threefold:

1. From the logistical point of view, I will start working with a more complex file structure, and uploading files to GitHub.

2. From the analytics point of view, this HW involves visualizing shot data of NBA players. More specifically, I will produce so-called “shot charts” for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries and visualizations.

3. From the report/communication standpoint, I will produce a report document that is not just a boring list of code-and-output without a narrative.

During the Data Preparation Stage, I downloaded the data, and merged the raw data sets to a master data file.

During the Core Analysis State, I made summaries of five player's performance and displayed their shots on courts.

Finally during the Reporting Stage, I wrote a report including introduction, motivation, background, data, analysis, discussion, and conclusion on this project.
